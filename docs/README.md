## What does it do?
This plugin adds extra functionality to your markdown used in the blog plugin from Rainlab.
It is a work-under-construction as new shorcodes are added all the time. This plugin is not in the October CMS marketplace
and no support is offered. It comes as it is.

The name of the plugin is quite explosive, but that is while this plugin is based on [`thunderer/shortcode`](https://github.com/thunderer/Shortcode)
package of Tomasz Kowalczyk.

## How to install
This plugin is not available in the marketplace of October CMS, so you have to install it manually.

Clone this repository to the `plugins\enovision` folder and name it `shortcodesthunder`.

```
git clone https://github.com/enovision/october-cms-shortcodesthunder shortcodesthunder

cd shortcodesthunder

composer install
```

from within the plugins/enovision folder.

The `enovision` folder might not exist, so you have to create that first.
